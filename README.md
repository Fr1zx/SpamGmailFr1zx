Usage
Once you have installed the tool, you can run it using the following command:
python spamgmailfr1zx.py
You will be prompted to enter the target email address, the attack text, and the number of times you want to send the spam email. The tool will then start sending the emails to the target address.


Important: Wait for the tool to complete its work and display the message "Thank you for using!"

This will allow you to send all emails at once and bypass spam protection.
